## Installing Dependencies

Before using the program, you need to install the required Python dependencies. We use `pip` to manage these dependencies. If you already have pip installed, you can proceed with the following steps. Otherwise, follow the instructions for your operating system below:

### Install pip (if not installed)

**On Linux/macOS:**

Python is usually pre-installed on Linux and macOS. Open a terminal and enter the following command to check if pip is installed:

```bash
pip --version
```

If you don't see version information, you need to install pip:

```bash
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
python3 get-pip.py
```

**On Windows:**

Check if pip is installed by opening a command prompt:

```bash
pip --version
```

If pip is not installed, download [get-pip.py](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py) to a folder on your computer. Then, open a command prompt and navigate to the folder where you downloaded `get-pip.py`. Run the following command:

```bash
python get-pip.py
```

### Install project dependencies

After you have pip installed, navigate to the project directory and run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

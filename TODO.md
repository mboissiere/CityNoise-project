# COMMENT CODE THAT I SUFFERED THRU DURING REFACTORING

# Objective of version 3 :

# speed it up (there are probably redundancies)

# investigate cartopy, seems like a better route for plotting actually

# if anything, this really probably should be a heatmap, and not a scatter plot.

# maybe it's not so stupid to be able to set a t_min and t_max. that way if animation is interrupted, we can start from later on?

# it's kind of annoying actually that the blue isn't all that impressive because if a latitude and longitude isn't "exactly right" well it won't be summed...

# a numpy approach of a mesh grid could be fine, so that points would be accumulated in areas

# and also computations arent too long. apparently scipy has good content for sparse matrices.

# MIGRATE TO GITHUB BECAUSE ACTUALLY MANUAL VERSIONING IS A MESS IF I WANT TO IMPLEMENT AN IDEA TO FUNCTIONAL OR TEST

# Set snapshot names - timesteps will be added automatically
